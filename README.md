Project Goal: Creating a social media based app to satisfy the theme of helping with the transitioning from work to the home. The application has the user post thoughts like a discussion post. We are aware this is similar to Yik Yak, but we want to put in more new features and ideas to show how this can help out with the WFH transition for people who need someone to talk to in a local radius.


What We Accomplished:
- Deleting post
- Uploading posts
- No photographs function of course
- Post disappears after 10 seconds (for demonstration purposes -- else it would be 24 hours)
- Imported a sign in registration and authentication idea.


What to do next:

- Try to import word filters to avoid cyber bullying.
- Use Google Maps, or a Maps API to try to work with user location idea.
- Overall work with the design.
