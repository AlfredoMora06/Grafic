Project Goal:
  Creating a social media based app to satisfy the theme of helping with the transitioning from work to the home.
  The application has the user post thoughts like a discussion post. 
  We are aware this is similar to Yik Yak, but we want to put in more new features and ideas to show how this can help
  out with the WFH transition for people who need someone to talk to in a local radius.
 
 
What to do next:

  - See how we can make the posts disappear after a few hours.
  - Try to import word filters to avoid cyber bullying.
  - No photographs can be uploaded due to privacy reasons.
